## Hello everyone and welcome to React!

Below are some helpful resources that will help you in this module

1. If you're using Atom as your text editor, download the [JSX plugin](https://orktes.github.io/atom-react/). This will give you some pretty great JSX syntax highlighting and will make coding in React much easier. After the package is installed, open up your `preferences` in Atom. Navigate to `packages` search for `react` then click `settings` amd make sure you check the box next to `Enabled For All JavaScript Files`

2. [prettier-atom](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom) is another great plugin. It's *very* opinionated but will automatically format you JS and React when you save a file. Use it if you want to and enable/disable semicolons depending on your preferences.

3. You might also want to enable [autosave](https://atom.io/packages/autosave) in Atom. This will automatically save your files onBlur or when they're closed. Open up `preferences/packages` in Atom then search for autosave, open `settings` and enable it if you want.
