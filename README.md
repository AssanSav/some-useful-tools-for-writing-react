## Hello everyone and welcome to React!

Below are some helpful resources that will help you in this module

1. If you're using Atom as your text editor, download the [JSX plugin](https://orktes.github.io/atom-react/). This will give you some pretty great JSX syntax highlighting and will make coding in React much easier. After the package is installed, open up your `preferences` in Atom. Navigate to `packages` search for `react` then click `settings` amd make sure you check the box next to `Enabled For All JavaScript Files`

2. [prettier-atom](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom) is another great plugin. It's *very* opinionated but will automatically format you JS and React when you save a file. Use it if you want to and enable/disable semicolons depending on your preferences.

3. You might also want to enable [autosave](https://atom.io/packages/autosave) in Atom. This will automatically save your files onBlur or when they're closed. Open up `preferences/packages` in Atom then search for autosave, open `settings` and enable it if you want.

4. Please remember that the [setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate) method in React is [asynchronous](https://medium.com/@wereHamster/beware-react-setstate-is-asynchronous-ce87ef1a9cf3).

4. [Semantic UI for React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) is a great CSS library written specifically for React. Make sure you read the [usage](https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage) section of the docs to see how to incorporate it into your React projects. **Make sure you're reading the docs for the react version of semantic, not the vanilla JS one.** Their other library uses jQuery which does not play well with React at all.

5. Install the [React Devtools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en). This gives you access to some pretty great tools that make it a lot easier to debug your programs in React. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools#faq) for the extension.

5. Most importantly, the official [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/), courtesty of FaceBook. THX FaceBook for creating this stellar library.
